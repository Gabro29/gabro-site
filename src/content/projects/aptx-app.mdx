## The Problem
With over 1,000 episodes, following *Detective Conan* is overwhelming. Viewers struggle to distinguish "Canon" (plot-relevant) episodes from "Fillers," or find specific cases they remember vaguely.

## User Experience
APTX transforms the viewing experience by putting search first:
-   **Contextual Search**: Users can filter by plot relevance ("Canon Only") or search by plot keywords (e.g., "Black Organization", "Heiji").
-   **Personalized Tracking**: An integrated note-taking system allows users to annotate episodes, essentially building a personal wiki.
-   **Direct Navigation**: Large touch-friendly controls designed for mobile interaction.

## Impact
The app provides a streamlined, ad-free utility that respects the user's time. By delivering a permissions-free, install-ready APK, it lowered the barrier to entry for users uncomfortable with complex app stores.
