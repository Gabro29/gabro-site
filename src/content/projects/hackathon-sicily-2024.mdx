## System Architecture

The project involved a rigorous data science workflow focused on **SIAS hourly rainfall data (2002–2023)**.

-   **ETL Pipeline**: Automated scripts to parse raw hourly precipitation logs from regional weather stations.
-   **Analysis Engine**: Statistical modules to calculate peak intensity duration and seasonal distribution shifts.
-   **Projection Model**: Linear extrapolation logic verified against historical trends to estimate 2050 scenarios.

## Technical Challenges

### Handling High-Frequency Time Series
Processing hourly data for 20 years across multiple stations resulted in a massive dataset. We optimized our Pandas operations using vectorized functions instead of loops, reducing processing time from minutes to seconds.

### Correlating Disparate Metrics
The core challenge was linking rainfall deficits (meteorological data) to real-world infrastructure stress (engineering data). We created a "stress index" that normalized both datasets, allowing us to visualize exactly when and where water infrastructure would fail under predicted drought conditions.

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed a shift toward **extremes**: wetter summers and drier winters, with torrential events becoming shorter but more intense. This creates a "double hazard" where water is scarce when needed, but overwhelming during storms, overwhelming current storage capacities.
