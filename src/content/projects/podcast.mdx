## The Problem
The Italian tech media landscape often swings between "AI will destroy us" alarmism and superficial hype. There was a lack of accessible content that treated students and professionals as intelligent actors capable of understanding the nuance.

## Content Strategy & UX
**Iperconnessi** treats the listener as a peer.
-   **Explainers**: We deconstruct complex architectures (Transformers, GANs) into mental models rather than math proofs.
-   **Expert Interviews**: We ask "how it fails" and "what are the trade-offs," moving beyond the standard marketing pitch.
-   **Feedback Loop**: Questions from the community drive future episode topics, creating a sense of ownership among listeners.

## Impact
The project successfully established a community of "technical curiosities," proving that there is a hunger for slow, thoughtful technical analysis over quick soundbites.
