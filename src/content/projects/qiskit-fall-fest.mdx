## The Problem
Quantum Computing is often perceived as an impenetrable field reserved for PhDs. Students at the University of Palermo lacked a structured entry point to explore this emerging technology.

## Event Experience
We designed a **Hybrid Event** to lower the barrier to entry:
-   **Scaffolded Learning**: The agenda moved from Theory (Professors) to Practice (Hands-on Labs) to Challenge (Hackathon), allowing students to build confidence incrementally.
-   **Mentorship Layer**: I led a team of mentors to debug code live, ensuring no student got stuck on setup issues—the #1 drop-off point for beginners.

## Impact
-   **Activation**: over 40 students wrote their first line of Quantum code.
-   **Community**: The event kickstarted a local interest group, connecting students directly with IBM Quantum representatives and resources.
