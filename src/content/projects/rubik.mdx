## The Inspiration
I’ve always been fascinated by the Rubik’s cube—not just solving it, but the math behind it. I wanted to build a simulator from scratch to force myself to truly understand **3D transformations**, **rotation matrices**, and input raycasting.

## Visual Experience
The project features a fully interactive 3D environment:
-   **Free Cam**: Mouse-controlled camera orbit to view the cube from any angle.
-   **Animated Moves**: Smooth interpolation for layer rotations, making the physics feel responsive.
-   **Scramble & Solve**: Built-in algorithms to randomize the state and restore it.

## Key Takeaways
This "small" experiment was a crash course in **Linear Algebra**. I learned that Euler angles are prone to gimbal lock and that Quaternions, while intimidating, are the superior tool for 3D rotation interpolation.
