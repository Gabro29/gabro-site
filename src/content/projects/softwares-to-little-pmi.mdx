## The Problem
Small retail businesses often operate on fragile manual processes—handwritten receipts, mental inventory tracking, and unorganized customer logs. This friction leads to **billing errors**, **lost revenue**, and significant time wasted on administration rather than sales.

## User Experience Design
The target users were non-technical staff who needed "set-and-forget" reliability.
-   **Zero-Friction Printing**: Integrated **SumatraPDF** to bypass system print dialogs, enabling "one-click" receipt printing.
-   **Hardware-Key Security**: Implemented a physical security check (USB serial validation) to prevent unauthorized access to financial data.
-   **Resilient Data**: Designed a triple-redundancy save system (Local + Network + Archive) to ensure zero data loss during power outages.

## Business Impact
Deploying these custom solutions transformed daily operations:
-   **Efficiency**: Reduced end-of-day accounting time by automating invoice generation.
-   **Accuracy**: Eliminated pricing errors common with manual lookup.
-   **Professionalism**: Replaced handwritten notes with branded, digital documentation, improving customer trust.
