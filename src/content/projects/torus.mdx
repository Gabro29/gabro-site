## The Inspiration
While reading a paper on dynamical systems (*Menini, Possieri, Tornambè*), I encountered the concept of "unfolding" a billiard table. Instead of calculating complex reflections at every wall, you can "mirror" the world and treat the ball's path as a straight line.

## Visual Gallery
The simulation demonstrates two distinct regimes:
-   **Periodic Motion**: The ball retraces its path perfectly, creating a closed loop.
-   **Dense Motion**: The trajectory never repeats, eventually painting the entire surface of the torus.

## The Math
To visualize this, I mapped the flat 2D billiard coordinates $(x,y)$ onto a 3D torus using the parametric embedding:

```math
\begin{cases}
X = (R + r\cos\omega)\cos\varphi \\
Y = (R + r\cos\omega)\sin\varphi \\
Z = r\sin\omega
\end{cases}
```

This allows us to see how a "straight line" in the unfolded plane wraps beautifully around the 3D donut shape.
