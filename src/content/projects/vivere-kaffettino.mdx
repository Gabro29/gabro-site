## The Problem
The *Vivere Ingegneria* association managed coffee payments via a physical cash box. This led to **change shortages**, **untracked debts**, and an inability to monitor stock levels remotely.

## User Experience
We built a frictionless "Tap & Go" system:
1.  **The User Action**: Members simply tap their NFC card on the ESP8266 reader.
2.  **Instant Feedback**: The Telegram bot instantly sends a notification confirming the transaction and current balance.
3.  **Bot Management**: Users can check their credit or report issues directly via chat, removing the need for a separate app.

## Business Impact
-   **Revenue Assurance**: Eliminated "I'll pay later" losses by enforcing digital credit checks.
-   **Operations**: Automated inventory alerts prevent stockouts of coffee pods.
-   **Adoption**: The integration with Telegram (a platform students already use) ensured near 100% adoption.
